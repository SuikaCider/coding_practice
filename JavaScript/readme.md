## JavaScript Roadmap

I didn't expect to learn JavaScript, but then I got _extremely_ intrigued by [BitBurner](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1812820/Bitburner/), a game built around the idea of having players write increasingly complex JavaScript scripts to automate things. The concept is very interesting to me, but I know nothing about JavaScript, so I haven't been able to make much progress in the game. 

Currently, my learning plan is to:

1. Work through FreeCodeCamp's [JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-v8/) course
2. Work through Leetcode's [30 Days of JavaScript course](https://leetcode.com/studyplan/30-days-of-javascript/)
3. Read through Quacksoul's ["JavaScript for BitBurner"](https://quacksouls.github.io/lyf/hello_README/) mini-course
4. Work trough [BitBurner's beginner guide](https://github.com/bitburner-official/bitburner-src/blob/dev/src/Documentation/doc/help/getting_started.md)
5. Play BitBurner while continuing to learn via [easy JavaScript problems on Leetcode]((https://leetcode.com/problemset/algorithms/?difficulty=EASY&page=1&sorting=W3sic29ydE9yZGVyIjoiREVTQ0VORElORyIsIm9yZGVyQnkiOiJBQ19SQVRFIn1d))

My hope is that I can learn enough to build some simple webscraping tools, which I could then use to create a database to do and make my own SQL project.
