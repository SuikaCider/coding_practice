# LeetCode's Java Script 30

I'm currently working through FCC's "[Data Structures and Algorithms with JavaScript](freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-v8/)" course, but I don't really like it. It's very "see and repeat" in nature and I don't think I'm learning much.

To reinforce my learning, I will work through the "[30 Days of JavaScript]([url](https://leetcode.com/studyplan/30-days-of-javascript/))" challenge. It consists of:

  - [] Closures (4 questions)
  - [] Basic array transformations (3 questions)
  - [] Function transformations (3 questions)
  - [] Promises and Time (8 questions)
  - [] JSON (8 questions)
  - [] Classes (3 questions

And after that, I'll work through some easy JavaScript challenges [like these ones](https://leetcode.com/problemset/algorithms/?difficulty=EASY&page=1&sorting=W3sic29ydE9yZGVyIjoiREVTQ0VORElORyIsIm9yZGVyQnkiOiJBQ19SQVRFIn1d)!
