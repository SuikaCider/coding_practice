# Coding Practice
This is a junk drawer where I'm keeping track of the problems/projects I work on while learning Python. You can see a roadmap of what I'm doing by referencing the `readme.md` file in the Python folder.

All problems I attempt will be presented in this structure:

1. Problem introduction
2. Preliminary questions / database exploration
3. Assignment questions (_+ discussion/learning/questions if my query is incorrect_)
4. A reflection on what I learned
5. My final solution

And if I learn anything particularly important while working on a project, I will export that note to the `KeyLearnings.md` file.
