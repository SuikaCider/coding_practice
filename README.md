# Coding Practice
This is a junk drawer where I'm keeping track of the projects I do while learning SQL and JavaScript â€” please open either of those folders to see a roadmap of what I'm currently learning.

Unless they're very short and simple (i.e., some early LeetCode problems), all documents should follow a roughly similar strutcure:

1. Problem introduction
2. Preliminary questions / database exploration
3. Assignment questions (_+ discussion/learning/questions if my query is incorrect_)
4. A reflection on what I learned
5. My final solution

I'm learning independently, so if you have suggestions/input, please reach out!
