# Coding Practice
This is a junk drawer where I'm keeping track of the projects I do while learning SQL and JavaScript. At some point it will contain projects for Tableau dashboards and Python, too. 

Each project will follow roughly the same macro structure:

1. Problem introduction
2. Preliminary questions / database exploration
3. Assignment questions (_+ discussion/learning/questions if my query is incorrect_)
4. A reflection on what I learned
5. My final solution

Please see my [SQL Learning Roadmap](https://github.com/SuikaCider/coding_practice/blob/main/SQL/SQL_roadmap.md) to see where I am currently at.

I'm learning independently, so if you have suggestions/input, please reach out!
