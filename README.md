# Coding Practice
This is a junk drawer where I'm keeping track of the problems/projects I work on while learning Python. You can see a roadmap of what I'm doing by referencing the `readme.md` file in the Python folder.

All problems I attempt will be presented in this structure:

1. Problem introduction
2. Attempt loop
    - My attempt at solving the problem
    - What I think went wrong and why
    - Repeat until solved
3. A reflection on what I learned
4. My final solution

And if I learn anything particularly important while working on a project, I will export that note to the `KeyLearnings.md` file.
