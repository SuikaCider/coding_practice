# Pomodoro Slices

—— Update

It seems like the answer is no. I am now deciding if I should use PySide or Swift/SwiftUI to create a desktop application. 

—— Question:
Can I do the below with python, SQL, and Tableau?
And maybe host it on the personal website we make in "Static Site Generator" project?

I'm still in the initial Python unit, though, so any comments you have are welcome. Whether direct respones to the above questions, food for thought, or just heads up about things a noob like me might be overlooking.

—— Problem:
I block my work time out in a very specific fashion ( [AJATT-style time boxing](https://web.archive.org/web/20220203132954/http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/timeboxing-trilogy-part-1-what-and-why/))

( {[8 minutes writing] → [1 minute flashcards]} → repeat 3 times →  [3 minutes exercise] ) → repeat 4 times → decide to continue or start new task

I write more usable words per hour this way than if I just sit and write for a straight hour. Unfortunately, it's also very esoteric, and there isn't an already-existing solution. So I thought I could make one for my personal project. 

—— Project:

I'd like to make a pomodoro timer that lets you customize each "slice" of the tomato. 
Slice the pomodoro up into slices, assiging each with a customizable tag + length
Allow each slice (or sequence of slices) to repeat # times
Save slices / slice configurations for use later
Export the time values for each slice (in minutes) to a spreadsheet
Visualize this information into pie charts of time per day/week/month
Visualize this into bar graphs per day/week/month

Later on I'd like to add basic habit tracking, so you can do things like compare words written per hour when you do/didn't eat breakfast. 

The idea is to have a customizable and minimal way to track where your time goes, and also see how X habits affect Y performance
