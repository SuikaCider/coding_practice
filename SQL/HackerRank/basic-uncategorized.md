<summary> ‚úÖ Resolved questions questions</summary>

- Is there ever a time where I will `SELECT` something other than `*` ?  
   - Only `SELECT` `*` if asked to return all information that fits certain parameters. If you know you are querying for a specific piece of information, a more specific field than `*` may be used.

<details>
<summary> Expand to see chicken scratch </summary>

  _Query all columns for all American cities in the CITY table with populations larger than 100000. The CountryCode for America is USA._

_The CITY table is described as follows:_

```
| Field       | Type           |
|-------------|----------------|
| ID          | NUMBER         |
| NAME        | VARCHAR2(17)   |
| COUNTRYCODE | VARCHAR2(3)    |
| DISTRICT    | VARCHAR2(20)   |
| POPULATION  | NUMBER         |

```

### My attempts

<details>
<summary> ‚ùå Attempt #1</summary>

I tried:

  ```
SELECT NAME
FROM CITY
WHERE COUNTRYCODE = 'USA'
WHERE POPULATION > 100000
  ```

Two errors:
- I forgot that I need to `select` all columns; the filtering will be done by the other commands
- I forgot that I needed to end in `;`
- I forgot the `and` parameter

</details>

<details>
<summary> ‚úÖ Attempt #1</summary>

I tried:

  ```
SELECT *
FROM CITY
WHERE COUNTRYCODE = 'USA'
  AND POPULATION > 100000;
  ```

And this worked. First problem of the book passed üòÖ

</details> 

### Key learnings

üß† I forgot a lot...  
‚ùì Is there ever a time where I will want to select something other than `*`?

_Query the NAME field for all American cities in the CITY table with populations larger than 120000. The CountryCode for America is USA._

_The CITY table is described as follows:_

```
| Field       | Type           |
|-------------|----------------|
| ID          | NUMBER         |
| NAME        | VARCHAR2(17)   |
| COUNTRYCODE | VARCHAR2(3)    |
| DISTRICT    | VARCHAR2(20)   |
| POPULATION  | NUMBER         |

```

### My attempts

<details>
<summary> ‚ùå Attempt #1</summary>

I tried:

  ```
SELECT * 
FROM CITY
WHERE POPULATION > 120000
    AND COUNTRYCODE = 'USA'
  ```

And this failed. It returned the name of the cities alongside quite a bit of other information.

</details>

<details>
<summary> ‚úÖ Attempt #2</summary>

I tried:

  ```
SELECT NAME 
FROM CITY
WHERE POPULATION > 120000
    AND COUNTRYCODE = 'USA'
  ```

This returned the names of the cities, as requested. 

</details> 

### Key learnings

üß† The reason I queried `*` previously is because the task was `query all columns`. This task specifically requested to return `NAME`.
