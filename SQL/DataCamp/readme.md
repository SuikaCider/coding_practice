# For your viewing sanity

This folder contains my solutions to the 11 SQL projects currently available on DataCamp as of June, 2024. Each file "shows my work", by which I mean to say that I include incorrect query attempts, what I learn from those errors, and also my initial thoughts/impressions on each problem. 

In each project I make note of:
* Key learnings, indicated by üß†
* Questions/curiosities, indicated by ‚ùì

A summary of insights gained from this batch of 11 projects, and (later) responses to the questions they prompted me to ask, can be found in [Key Learnings](https://github.com/SuikaCider/coding_practice/blob/main/DataCamp/SQL/0.%20DataCamp%20key%20learnings.md).

_Note: This folder is my first experience with both GitHub and Markdown. The files get significantly more readable from project #4._
