# Analyzing students' mental health

Does going to university in a different country affect your mental health? A Japanese international university surveyed its students in 2018 and published a study the following year that was approved by several ethical and regulatory boards.

The study found that international students have a higher risk of mental health difficulties than the general population, and that social connectedness (belonging to a social group) and acculturative stress (stress associated with joining a new culture) are predictive of depression.

Explore the `students` data using PostgreSQL to find out if you would come to a similar conclusion for international students and see if the length of stay is a contributing factor.

Here is a data description of the columns you may find helpful.

## Project progress

[√] Created GitHub landing page  

[√] Tried project once by myself  

[√] Checked solution — annotated what I learned if my answer was wrong  

[√] Document will not be edited further  

  * Note: I may later come back to respond to some of the questions I asked myself. 

---

  ## Preliminary questions 
I would like to run a few queries to see what this database looks like before I begin attempting to answer the assignment's questions.

### Question I: What am I working with, here?

```
SELECT * 
FROM students
LIMIT 10;
```

Impressions:
* That's... that's... a massive amount of columns
* Ok, I guess I'm going to start by `COUNT()`'ing some of the pieces of data and getting rough `AVG()`'s of other things

### Question II: What do these 3 tests mean, anyway?

The database records the scores certain students got on three tests. I spent some time reading about what these different dests measure, and also using some aggregate functions to learn about the range of possible scores for each test. 

<details><summary>Overview of tests</summary>
* [PHQ-9 test](https://med.stanford.edu/fastlab/research/imapp/msrs/_jcr_content/main/accordion/accordion_content3/download_256324296/file.res/PHQ9%20id%20date%2008.03.pdf) → a self-report screening test for likelihood/severity depression.
  * Total score indicated by `todep` (min=0, avg=8, maxObserved=25, maxPossible=27)
  * Individual items also listed (9 total)
* [SCS test](https://scales.arabpsychology.com/s/social-connectedness-scale/) → a self-report questoinnaire that assesses 4 dimensions of social connectedness (belongingness, closeness, support, satisfaction).
  * Total score indicated by `tosc` (min=8, max=48, avg=37)
  * Individual items also listed (8 total)
  * A more updated version of this test exists (SCS-R) with 20 items   
* [ASISS test](https://www.libs.uga.edu/reserves/docs/scans/lundeen%20-%20an%20acculturative.pdf) → a self-report test that records how much stress an immigrant (here: international student) feels while navigating the acculturation process. 
  * Total score indicated by `toas` (min=36. avg=72, maxObserved=145, maxPossible=180)
  * 1–5 Likert rating of 36 statements, grouped into 7 categories

* I initially felt overwhelmed because there were ~50 rows, but that's actually because the dataset includes student responses to all items on each of the three tests. I may explore that data personally, but virtually all of it is useless, so far as the assignment goes.
* It would be interesting to compare scores of students abroad vs those at home, _or_ to compare the same students' scores the year before they went abroad vs the year they went abroad.
</details>

### Question III: Stay brackets

The assignment asks that the output contain 5 columns and 9 rows. I'm guesing that there are 9 brackets for how long people have stayed, so I'll run a few queries to confirm that.

<details><summary>How many rows are there?</summary>
```
SELECT DISTINCT stay, count(stay)
FROM students
GROUP BY stay;
```

Which returned:

| Stay | Count |
|------|-------|
| 1    | 115   |
| 2    | 52    |
| 3    | 69    |
| 4    | 23    |
| 5    | 3     |
| 6    | 3     |
| 7    | 1     |
| 8    | 1     |
| 10   | 1     |
| null |       |

I'm a bit confused as to what _null_ is here, so I'll check it:

</details>

<details><summary>What does `null` mean in this data?</summary>

```
SELECT *
FROM students
WHERE stay IS null;
```

Indeed, there are 17 people which have no data for eveything except results from what seems to be the SCS test. I'm not sure why that happened, but it tells me that I can ignore it for my final output. I guess this means I will have to use `WHERE stay BETWEEN 1 AND 10` in order to exclude this `null` 10th row. 

Now I want to confirm that this will work:

</details>

<details><summary>Testing `BETWEEN` command</summary

```
SELECT DISTINCT stay, inter_dom WHERE inter_dom = 'Inter' AS count_int
FROM students
WHERE stay BETWEEN 1 AND 10
GROUP BY stay, count_int
ORDER BY stay;
```

I got an error — it seems that I can't bundle a condition into an alias. I'm sure there's a way to do that, but for now, I'll just make one big filter and count the people who fit that condition.

```
SELECT stay, COUNT(*) AS count_int
FROM students
WHERE inter_dom = 'Inter' AND stay BETWEEN 1 AND 10
GROUP BY stay
ORDER BY stay;
```
</details>

And now I know that there are 9 "brackets" of `stay`

| Stay | Count_int |
|------|-----------|
| 1    | 95        |
| 2    | 39        |
| 3    | 46        |
| 4    | 14        |
| 5    | 1         |
| 6    | 3         |
| 7    | 1         |
| 8    | 1         |
| 10   | 1         |

Cool. That worked. Getting average test scores is going to be easy (_cross fingers_), so I'm pretty sure that I now have everything I need to answer this project's question.

### Question IV: How `ROUND()` works

I lied. I'm going to need to do one more round of queries to figure out how to round test scores to 2 decimal places. 

<details><summary>How does `ROUND()` work?</summary>
Initial blind attempt:

```
Select ROUND(AVG(todep),2) AS average_phq, ROUND(AVG(tosc),2) AS average_scs, ROUND(AVG(toas),2) AS average_as
FROM students
LIMIT 10;

```

And wouldn't you know it, that actually worked the first time. Sometimes you get lucky.

|average_phq|average_scs|average_as|
|-------|-------|-------|
|8.19|37.47|72.38|

And I'm pretty sure that _now_ I'm ready to approach the assignment question.

  ## Assignment questions 

  ### 🎯 Question #1: How does staying in a different country impact your mental health?
  
Question text:
> Explore and analyze the students data to see how the length of stay (stay) impacts the average mental health diagnostic scores of the international students present in the study.
>
> Requriements:
> * Nine rows, five columns
> * Column namess & order: `stay`, `count_int`, `average_phq`, `average_scs`, and `average_as`
> * `AVG()` columns should be rounded to 2 decimal places
> * `count_int` column should show how many learners stayed for each "time interval"
> * Results sorted in descending order
>
> Notes: This might take multiple cells/queries!

<details><summary>Impressions</summary>
* This is a long question!
* I haven't done a project that required multiple queries working together before..
* I need to review how `ROUND()` works
* What's a DataFrame? Is it a thing, or just a DataCamp thing?

Impression 2 (post _preliminary questions_)
* This doesn't need multiple queries working together. The results can be gotten with one query, but I needed a few queries to (a) figure out what was in the database and (b) make sure my syntax was correct.
* I'm hoping that I can simply combine the key bits from my preliminary question queries to get the correct answer in one go.

</details>

  Here goes:

<details><summary>❌ Query 1: </summary>

```  
SELECT stay, COUNT(*) AS count_int, ROUND(AVG(todep),2) AS average_phq, ROUND(AVG(tosc),2) AS average_scs, ROUND(AVG(toas),2) AS average_as
FROM students
WHERE inter_dom = 'Inter' AND stay BETWEEN 1 AND 10
HAVING stay, count_int, average_phq, average_scs, average_as
ORDER BY stay DESC;
```

.... this resulted in an error. I thought that `ROUND(AVG(...),2)` would count as an aggregate function, so I used `HAVING` instead of `GROUP BY`, but it seems this isn't the case. Does this mean that aggregate functions aren't consided aggregate functions if they are nested inside of `ROUND()`?

</details>

<details><summary>❌ Query 2: `HAVING` → `GROUP BY`</summary>

Anyway, swapping `HAVING` out for `GROUP BY`:

```
SELECT stay, COUNT(*) AS count_int, ROUND(AVG(todep),2) AS average_phq, ROUND(AVG(tosc),2) AS average_scs, ROUND(AVG(toas),2) AS average_as
FROM students
WHERE inter_dom = 'Inter' AND stay BETWEEN 1 AND 10
GROUP BY stay, count_int, average_phq, average_scs, average_as
ORDER BY stay DESC;
```
... and this also resulted in an error. `count_int, average_phq, average_scs, average_as` are indeed still considered to be aggregate functions, so I can't include them in `GROUP BY`. The assignment wants columns to be presented in a specific order, so that might be an issue. I'm going to change to `GROUP BY stay` for now and hope that the remaining columns will respect the order noted in `SELECT`.

</details>

<details><summary>✅ Query 3: Removing aggregate functions from `GROUP BY` </summary>

```
SELECT stay, COUNT(*) AS count_int, ROUND(AVG(todep),2) AS average_phq, ROUND(AVG(tosc),2) AS average_scs, ROUND(AVG(toas),2) AS average_as
FROM students
WHERE inter_dom = 'Inter' AND stay BETWEEN 1 AND 10
GROUP BY stay
ORDER BY stay DESC;
```
</details>

Query 3 yielded the correct output:

| Stay | Count_int | Average_PHQ | Average_SCS | Average_AS |
|------|-----------|-------------|-------------|------------|
| 10   | 1         | 13          | 32          | 50         |
| 8    | 1         | 10          | 44          | 65         |
| 7    | 1         | 4           | 48          | 45         |
| 6    | 3         | 6           | 38          | 58.67      |
| 5    | 1         | 0           | 34          | 91         |
| 4    | 14        | 8.57        | 33.93       | 87.71      |
| 3    | 46        | 9.09        | 37.13       | 78         |
| 2    | 39        | 8.28        | 37.08       | 77.67      |
| 1    | 95        | 7.48        | 38.11       | 72.8       |


<details><summary> this is a worrying trend... </summary>
(Note: Sample size for long-term stay is very small... but it's a bit unnerving to see that, as students' stay grew from 1 to 4 years, they became more depressed, les connected, and faced greater accultural stress. I wonder if this is because 1 year abroad is simply a fun "gap year" experience, but if you're staying longer, then you're likely doing a full-time program in Japan and thus increasingly worried about having to assimilate to the culture, do your dissertation, find a job, etc? Also... why are there people who have been international students for 5–10 years? BA, MA, PhD all done in Japan, I suppose?

## Reflections on how I did

I'm quite happy with my results. I was initially worried that I would struggle, but this was actually a very straightforward assignment, once I stepped back to consider the puzzle pieces available to me and figure out how they fit together. 

❓ Question: if the columns are sorted according to `SELECT` order, then what is `GROUP BY` for?
