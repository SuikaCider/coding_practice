# Key Learnings
These are the main things I lerned while working through this problem set:

1. `GROUP BY` vs `HAVING` | Source: [Charging Data](https://github.com/SuikaCider/coding_practice/blob/main/DataCamp/SQL/2.%20Analyzing-Electric-Vehicle-Charging-Habits.md)
</br> ðŸ§  Aggregate functions cannot be used with `GROUP BY`. Must use `HAVING`.

2. `WHERE` conditions | Source: [Charging Data](https://github.com/SuikaCider/coding_practice/blob/main/DataCamp/SQL/2.%20Analyzing-Electric-Vehicle-Charging-Habits.md)
</br> ðŸ§  Aggregate functions cannot be used with `WHERE` because ___

## Pending questions

Things I wondered about while working on projects (often in response to errors) that I figured I should probably find the answer to.

1. [Debt Statistics](https://github.com/SuikaCider/coding_practice/blob/main/DataCamp/SQL/1.%20Analyzing%20International%20Debt%20Statistics.md) | Why is there a column for `lowest_repayment` even whe nI didn't add this to the `GROUP BY` statement?  
2. [Debt Statistics](https://github.com/SuikaCider/coding_practice/blob/main/DataCamp/SQL/1.%20Analyzing%20International%20Debt%20Statistics.md) | Why can `ORDER BY` be used with aggregate functions, but `GROUP BY` cant? OR is `MIN()` not considered to be an aggregate function?  
3. [Charging Data](https://github.com/SuikaCider/coding_practice/blob/main/DataCamp/SQL/2.%20Analyzing-Electric-Vehicle-Charging-Habits.md) | What is the correct way to refer to rows/columns/cells in SQL?  
4. [Student Mental Health](https://github.com/SuikaCider/coding_practice/blob/main/DataCamp/SQL/3.%20Analyzing%20students'%20mental%20health.md) | If columns are sorted according to `SELECT` order by default, why does `GROUP BY` matter? Could I not just specify the column order in `SELECT`?
