# Project: Analyze International Debt Statistics

Humans not only take debts to manage necessities. A country may also take debt to manage its economy. For example, infrastructure spending is one costly ingredient required for a country's citizens to lead comfortable lives. The World Bank is the organization that provides debt to countries.

In this project, you are going to analyze international debt data collected by The World Bank. The dataset contains information about the amount of debt (in USD) owed by developing countries across several categories. You are going to find the answers to the following questions:

* What is the number of distinct countries present in the database?

* What country has the highest amount of debt?

* What country has the lowest amount of repayments?

Below is a description of the table you will be working with:

<details>
<summary> Database: international_debt </summary>

| Column | Definition | Data Type |
|-|-|-|
|country_name|Name of the country|`varchar`|
|country_code|Code representing the country|`varchar`|
|indicator_name|Description of the debt indicator|`varchar`|
|indicator_code|Code representing the debt indicator|`varchar`|
|debt|Value of the debt indicator for the given country (in current US dollars)|`float`|

</details>

## Project progress

My progress through the project is as follows.

* [√] Created GitHub landing page  

* [√] Redid the project  
 
* [√] Checked solution — annotated what I learned if my answer was wrong _(EDIT: I got everything right on the first time, so I commented in some issues I recalled from my first attempt...)_  

* [√] Document will not be edited further  

---

## Preliminary questions

I actually went through this project once before I created a GitHub account. I will go through it again one more time, hopefully making less mistakes.


### Question I. What does the table look like?

Most of my mistakes the first time happened because I just assumed what the database looked like, without actually looking at it. As such, before I start, I will do some initial queries to see what the database looks like. 

```
SELECT *
FROM international_debt
LIMIT 10;
```

<details>
  <summary>Which gave me a result of...</summary>

</details>

<details><summary>Impressions:</summary>
* A single country can be listed several different times, sa they will have different types of debt
* There are different indicators and indicator codes, and I don't know what the difference is

</details>

### Question II: How many unique countries are there?

```
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT country_name) AS unique_countries
FROM international_debt;
```

|unique_countries|
|------|
| 124 |

### Question III: What do these debt codes mean?

Now I want to understand what these different debt indicators refer to, so I can understand what types of debt a country might possible have.



```
SELECT DISTINCT indicator_code, indicator_name
FROM international_debt;
```

While very simple, this gave me a helpful overview of how the debt was being categorized.

There are 24 unique ways you can be in debt....

### IV: What are the most commmon ways to be in debt?

While not a required question, nor information that will help me with this assignment, I'm curious about what, exactly, is putting most countries in debt.

```
SELECT indicator_name, COUNT(indicator_code) as country_count

GROUP BY indicator_code, indicator_name
ORDER BY country_count DESC

It's interesting to me that all represented countries have certain types of debt (6 types of debt are held by all countries), but that the least common debt type is held by only 19/124 countries. I wonder what puts those 19 countries in this situation, where the other countries don't?

### Question IV: What sort of countries have that "rare" debt?

The least common type of debt is `DT.DIS.PROP.CD`. I wonder what sort of countries have ethis debt, and how much they owe. 

If I had more time I would compare this `debt` vs the amount owed by other countries, or country A `DT.DIS.PROP.CD debt` vs COUNTRY A `SUM(debt)`, but for now I'm happy just to see what the countries are.

```
SELECT country_name, debt
FROM international_debt
WHERE indicator_code = 'DT.DIS.PROP.CD'
ORDER BY debt DESC;

The debt is all in USD, but they're very big numbers and are hard to take in at a glance. Next time maybe it would be better to use `ROUND()` to turn it into hundreds of thousands of debt?

## Assignment questions

Now for the questions DataCamp actually wants me to answer.

### 🎯 Question 1: How many distinct countries are in the databae?

Oh, I already answered this question above. 


```
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT country_name) AS total_distinct_countries 
FROM international_debt;
```

|unique_countries|
|------|
| 124 |

### 🎯 Question 2: Which country has the highest amount of debt? 

A mistake I made the first time I tried this (unfortunately I don't have those attempts) was not realizing that there are ~24 types of debt, meaning that countries are listed multiple times in the database, so I need to query not `debt` but rather `SUM(debt)`. With that detail in mind, this is another very simple query:

```
SELECT country_name, SUM(debt) AS total_debt
FROM international_debt
GROUP BY country_name
ORDER BY total_debt DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

Which yields:

|country_name|total_debt|
|------------|------------|
| China | 285793494734.2 |


### 🎯 Question 3: Which country has the lowest amount of DT.AMT.DLXF.CD repayments?

I know that there exists the `MIN()` query to return the minimum value in a column. That means this should be quite straightforward. It's very similar in logic as the preivous query.

```
SELECT country_name, indicator_name, MIN(debt) AS lowest_repayment
FROM international_debt
WHERE indicator_code='DT.AMT.DLXF.CD'
GROUP BY country_name, indicator_name
ORDER BY lowest_repayment
LIMIT 1;
```
Which yields:

|country_name|indicator_name|lowest_repayment|
|------------|------------|------------|
| Timor-Leste | Principal repayments on external debt, long-term (AMT, current US$) | 825000 |

---
## Pending questions

What I don't understand and need to figure out:
* ❓ Why is there a column for `lowest_repayment` even when I didn't add this to the `GROUP BY` statement?
* ❓ Why can `ORDER BY` be used with aggregate functions, but `GROUP BY` cant? OR is `MIN()` not considered to be an aggregate function?
