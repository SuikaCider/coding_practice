# TopSQL 50 ‚Äî basic `JOIN` challenges

There are 9 problems which focus on the use of `JOIN`. Below find the problems, my queries to solve those problems, and anything I learn from writing these queries. 

The final two problems are of "medium" difficulty (so far I have only solved "easy" problems) so they will likely require more attempts than I've needed thus far.

## üéØ Question 1: Replace employee ID w/ unique identifier

Question text:
> Write a solution to show the **unique ID** of each user, If a user does not have a unique ID replace just show `null`.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

<details>
  <summary>See `Employees` and `EmployeeUNI` Schema Here</summary>

Table: Employees


| Column Name   | Type    |
|---------------|---------|
| id            | int     |
| name          | varchar |

id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table contains the id and the name of an employee in a company.
 

Table: EmployeeUNI


| Column Name   | Type    |
|---------------|---------|
| id            | int     |
| unique_id     | int     |

(id, unique_id) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table contains the id and the corresponding unique id of an employee in the company.

</details>

<details><summary>‚úÖ Attempt #1</summary>

```
SELECT e2.unique_id AS unique_id, e.name AS name
FROM Employees e
LEFT JOIN EmployeeUNI e2
ON e.id = e2.id
```
</details>

<details><summary>Comments</summary>

I'm happy that I remembered that `INNER JOIN` would not return NULL values, while `LEFT JOIN` would. I also remembered to set `EmployeeUNI` as the left table... but not until I reached the end of my code and thought about it.

Joins are still difficult for me and I should practice more.

üß† `FROM` and `JOIN` process before `SELECT`, so I select `e.name` even though `Employee` doesn't get aliased as `e` until line 2. Maybe I should write the `SELECT` line last?
