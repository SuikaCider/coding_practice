# SQL Roadmap

For lack of initial direction, I've set an initial goal of passing [DataCamp's "SQL Associate" certification test](https://www.datacamp.com/certification/sql-associate). In order to pass this test, I will need to complete their `SQL Fundamentals` roadmap, which includes:

1. [√] Introduction to SQL (2 hrs)  
2. [√] Intermediate SQL (4 hrs)  
3. [√] Project: Analyzing Students' Mental Health (1 hr)  
4. [~] Joining Data in SQL (4 hrs)  
5. [] Data Manipulation in SQL (4 hrs)  
6. [] PostgreSQL Summary Stats and Windows Functions (4 hrs)
7. [] Functions for Manipulating Data in PostgreSQL (4 hrs)
8. [] Database Design (4 hrs)
9. [] Benchmark: Data Analysis in SQL  (_A series of timed 60–120 second challenges. 2 attempts per week. After achieving a certain score, I'll be eligible to attempt the SQL Associate exam._)

## Projects to supplement the above curriculum

I really enjoy project-based learning, so I figure that I will just work through all the projects:

1. [11 SQL projects from DataCamp](https://github.com/SuikaCider/coding_practice/tree/main/SQL/DataCamp) (currently 3/11)  
2. [HackerRank's 39 "basic" SQL tasks](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/sql?filters%5Bskills%5D%5B%5D=SQL%20%28Basic%29)
3. [LeetCode's "SQL 50" challenge](https://leetcode.com/studyplan/top-sql-50/) (currently 5/50)

And maybe some of the [237 "easy" problems from ScrataScratch](https://platform.stratascratch.com/coding?code_type=1&difficulties=1&page_size=25&page=10) or the [19 "easy" ones from Data Lemur](https://datalemur.com/questions?category=SQL).

While I'm having fun with this, I'm not sure how much it will transfer to "actual" work.

## After becoming a certified ✨SQL Associate✨

And I hope that will be enough to achieve the SQL Associate certification.

Afterwards, I'll worry about:
1. HackerRank and LeetCode both have many intermediate and advanced SQL problems to work through
2. It looks like I'l need to learn Tableau or PowerBI to visualize the results of my SQL queries. Tableau actually has [a free public data visualization community](https://public.tableau.com/), so I guess later on I will get involved with that and try to build a portfolio by (a) building/sharing Tableau dashboards and (b) contributing to some larger projects that I find interesting
3. Reddit suggests "not learning more than intermediate SQL because you can do all of that with Python with less effort." I'm not sure if that's true, but I do know that Python is necessary for me to begin working on NLP projects, so at some point, once I feel that I've attained a practical level of ability with SQL, I'll move on to Python. (And deeply, deeply, deeply hope that SQL and Python can work together.)
