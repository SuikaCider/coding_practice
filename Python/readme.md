# Python Roadmap

I didn't expect to start learning Python right now, but after getting really into JavaScript via the game BitBurner (see [JS roadmap](https://github.com/SuikaCider/coding_practice/tree/main/JavaScript)), I started looking into other "learn by playing a game" approaches to programming. That led me to discover [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev/u/quirkydish22), a product in which you learn backend development (python/Go/SQL/JS) by building a role-playing game. 
  
The first portion of Boot.dev's curriculum is conducted in Python, so my Python journey starts there. 
  
I will learn:

Work to be done in Python unless (otherwise specified). 
  
1. [Learn Python](https://boot.dev/learn/learn-python)
2. [Learn Shells and Terminals](https://www.boot.dev/learn/learn-shells-and-terminals)
3. [Learn Git](https://www.boot.dev/learn/learn-git)
4. [Learn Object-Oriented Programming](https://boot.dev/learn/learn-object-oriented-programming)
5. [Learn Functional Programming](https://boot.dev/learn/learn-functional-programming)
6. [Learn Algorithms](https://boot.dev/learn/learn-algorithms)
7. [Learn Data Structures](https://boot.dev/learn/learn-data-structures)
8. Learn Memory Management (C) _(curriculum pending)_
  
Which requires me to also complete four projects:
  
1. Project: [Build a Book-bot (Python, VS Code](https://boot.dev/learn/build-bookbot)
2. Project: Build an Asteroids Game _(project pending)_
3. Project: [Build a Static Site Generator](https://www.boot.dev/learn/build-static-site-generator)
4. Project: [Build a Maze Solver](https://boot.dev/learn/build-maze-solver-python)
5. Personal Project #1 _(project pending)_
