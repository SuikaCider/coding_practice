# Project: Analyzing Vehicle Charging Habits

As electronic vehicles (EVs) become more popular, there is an increasing need for access to charging stations, also known as ports. To that end, many modern apartment buildings have begun retrofitting their parking garages to include shared charging stations. A charging station is shared if it is accessible by anyone in the building.

But with increasing demand comes competition for these ports — nothing is more frustrating than coming home to find no charging stations available! In this project, you will use a dataset to help apartment building managers better understand their tenants’ EV charging habits.

The data has been loaded into a PostgreSQL database with a table named `charging_sessions` with the following columns:

<details> 
  <summary>Database: charging_sessions </summary>

| Column | Definition | Data type |
|-|-|-|
|`garage_id`| Identifier for the garage/building|`VARCHAR`|
|`user_id` | Identifier for the individual user|`VARCHAR`|
|`user_type`|Indicating whether the station is `Shared` or `Private`| `VARCHAR` |
|`start_plugin`|The date and time the session started |`DATETIME`|
|`start_plugin_hour`|The hour (in military time) that the session started | `NUMERIC`|
|`end_plugout`|The date and time the session ended | `DATETIME` |
|`eng_plugin_hour`|The hour (in military time) that the session ended | `NUMERIC`|
|`duration_hours`| The length of the session, in hours|`NUMERIC`|
|`el_kwh`| Amount of electricity used (in Kilowatt hours)|`NUMERIC`|
|`month_plugin`| The month that the session started |`VARCHAR`|
|`weekdays_plugin`| The day of the week that the session started|`VARCHAR`|

</details>

## Preliminary questions

I would like to run a few queries to see what this database looks like before I begin attempting to answer the assignment's questions.

### (I) What does this database look like?

In Datacamp's first project, [Analyzing International Debt Statistics](DataCamp/analyzing-international-debt-statistics.md) I got the second question wrong because I did not preview the database output and/or did not know about how debt is tracked. I assumed that each row would be a country plus its gross national debt, but the database actually contained multiple different types of debt. This meant that each country was listed multiple times: one per debt code. As such, I needed to `SELECT` not `debt`, but rather `SUM(debt)`. 

To avoid having this issue again, I am first going to query the entire database. 

```
SELECT *
FROM charging_sessions
LIMIT 10;
```

Which gave me an output of:

</details> 

My first impression is that there are multiple garages, as represented by the primary key `garage_id`, and that there's a foreign key (?) `user_id` which gives two pieces of information: a particular user of a particular garage. It seems that multiple charges are logged for each user, and I can see the duration of their charge in addition to when (time/weekday/month) it happened. This means I should probaby use `DISTINCT` when doing latear queries. 

I'm not sure why we need both `started_plugin` and `started_plugin_hour` + `end_plugin` and `end_plugin_hour`. I initially thought this was to calculate `duration_hours` by doing `SUM(end_plugin_hour - start_plugin_hour)` but `..._hour` is rounded to the nearest hour whereas `duration_hours` is in decimal points. It seems reasonable that aggregate functions can't be done on `DATETIME` data type, though? 

### (II) How many distinct parties are there?

The above output shows me that there are multiple garages, multiple users, and multiple charges for user. To get an idea of the amount of how much information I am working with, I want to know how many unique users and garages there are. 

```
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT garage_id) AS garage_count, COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS user_count
FROM charging_sessions;
```

Which gave me an output of:

| garage_count | user_count |
| ------------ | ---------- |
| 24           | 97         |

Now that I know what I'm working with, I'm ready to start working through DataCamp's assignment questions.

## Assignment questions

Now that I know a bit about the table, I am ready to approach the assignment's questions. 


### 🎯 Question 1: Unique users per garage

Question text: 
> Find the number of unique individuals that use each garage’s shared charging stations. The output should contain two columns: garage_id and num_unique_users. Sort your results by the number of unique users from highest to lowest. Save the result as unique_users_per_garage.

Impression: This is very straightforward. 

———Query attempt #1
~~~
SELECT garage_id, COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS num_unique_users
FROM charging_sessions
GROUP BY garage_id, num_unique_users
ORDER BY num_unique_users DESC
LIMIT 5;
~~~

Result: ERROR  
→ _What I learned: aggregate functions cannot be used with `GROUP BY`._  
→ _Comment: I don't exactly understand the difference between `GROUP BY` and `ORDER BY`. I guess that `GROUP BY` determines the left>right order of my columns, while `ORDER BY` determines the asc/desc order of the data within those columns?   


———Query attempt #2
~~~
SELECT garage_id, COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS num_unique_users
FROM charging_sessions
GROUP BY garage_id
ORDER BY num_unique_users DESC
LIMIT 5;
~~~
Result: 
| garage_id | num_unique_users |
|-----------|------------------|
| Bl2       | 22               |
| AsO2      | 18               |
| UT9       | 16               |
| AdO3      | 6                |
| AsO10     | 5                |

Note: there are more garages than this, but DataCamp's prompt asked that it be limited to 5 results. 

——— Query attempt #3  

It occurred to be while reading question #2 that I missed the **shared** filter for this question. I updated the above query to exclude `Private` charging stations.

~~~
SELECT garage_id, COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS num_unique_users
FROM charging_sessions
WHERE user_type = 'Shared'
GROUP BY garage_id
ORDER BY num_unique_users DESC
LIMIT 5;
~~~

Output: 
| garage_id | num_unique_users |
|-----------|------------------|
| Bl2       | 18               |
| AsO2      | 17               |
| UT9       | 16               |
| AdO3      | 3                |
| MS1       | 2                |

I noticed that the `num_unique_users` value changed, whereas `garage_id` stayed the same. This tells me that garages can have both `Shared` and `Private` charging stations.

### 🎯 Question #2: Top 10 charging times

Question text:
> Find the top 10 most popular charging start times (by weekday and start hour) for sessions that use **shared** charging stations. Your result should contain three columns: `weekdays_plugin`, `start_plugin_hour`, and a column named `num_charging_sessions` containing the number of plugins on that weekday at that hour. Sort your results from the most to the least number of sessions. Save the result as `most_popular_shared_start_times`

Impression: I feel a bit intimidated. But I can see that I will need to do:
* `WHERE` to filter by `user_type = 'shared'`
* `GROUP BY` to arrange according to `weekdays_plugin` and `start_plugin_hour`
* `COUNT(???)` some arithmetic done with the above two fields to get the amount of start times per hour
* `ORDER BY` descending, from most to least
* `LIMIT 10` since I only want the top 10 times

————Query attempt #1
```
SELECT weekdays_plugin, start_plugin_hour, COUNT(start_plugin_hour)
WHERE user_type = 'Shared'
GROUP BY weekdays_plugin, start_plugin_hour, COUNT(start_plugin_hour)
ORDER BY COUNT(start_plugin_hour)
LIMIT 10;
```

RESULT: ERROR
1. I forgot to add `FROM`  .........
2. Again, I've forgotten that aggregate functions cannot be used in `GROUP BY`

————Query attempt #2:
```
SELECT weekdays_plugin, start_plugin_hour, COUNT(start_plugin_hour) 
FROM charging_sessions
AS num_charging_sessions
WHERE user_type = 'Shared'
GROUP BY weekdays_plugin, start_plugin_hour
ORDER BY COUNT(start_plugin_hour)
LIMIT 10;
```
<details>
<summary> Which gave me a result of... </summary>

| weekdays_plugin | start_plugin_hour | count |
|-----------------|-------------------|-------|
| Monday          | 5                 | 1     |
| Sunday          | 3                 | 1     |
| Friday          | 4                 | 1     |
| Wednesday       | 1                 | 1     |
| Thursday        | 1                 | 1     |
| Thursday        | 2                 | 1     |
| Tuesday         | 2                 | 1     |
| Wednesday       | 5                 | 1     |
| Tuesday         | 7                 | 1     |
| Monday          | 1                 | 1     |

</details>

Impression: 
* This seems to be wrong. There's only one person charging per hour, and there are many people charging at like 2 AM.
* Ahh, I sorted ascending, not descending.

————Query attempt #3:
The above code gave me the _least_ popular charge times. I've changed the `ORDER BY` sort from ASC to DESC to get the _most_ popular charge times. 

```
SELECT weekdays_plugin, start_plugin_hour, COUNT(start_plugin_hour) 
FROM charging_sessions
AS num_charging_sessions
WHERE user_type = 'Shared'
GROUP BY weekdays_plugin, start_plugin_hour
ORDER BY COUNT(start_plugin_hour) DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
<details>
<summary> And the output now looks much more reasonable: </summary>

| in      | start_plugin_hour | count |
|---------|-------------------|-------|
| Sunday  | 17                | 30    |
| Friday  | 15                | 28    |
| Thursday| 19                | 26    |
| Thursday| 16                | 26    |
| Wednesday| 19               | 25    |
| Sunday  | 18                | 25    |
| Sunday  | 15                | 25    |
| Monday  | 15                | 24    |
| Friday  | 16                | 24    |
| Tuesday | 16                | 2     |

</details>

Impression:
* This makes much more sense. People start charging their car when they get home from work, and the most popular charging day is Sunday, as people are making sure their car is ready for the work week.

### 🎯 Question #3: Super chargers
Question text:
> Find the users whose average charging duration last longer than 10 hours when using shared charging stations. Your result should contain two columns: `user_id` and `avg_charging_duration`. Sort your result from highest to lowest average charging duration. Save the result as `long_duration_shared_users`.

Impressions:
* This seems more straightforward.
* I know I have a `user_id` key and `duration_hours` field, so I can easily track the total charging time per user with `SUM()`
* I need to leran how to call rows and columns and commands in SQL...
* I know I learned something about filtering for results that are above a certain amount, but I don't remember what the command to o that was.
* Edit: checked notes, looks like it should be `WHERE avg_charging_duration >= 10`
* I didn't read carefully enough. I'm not looking for `SUM(duration_hours)` but rather `AVG(duration_hours)`

————Query attempt #1:
```
SELECT user_id, AVG(duration_hours) AS avg_charging_duration
FROM charging_sessions
WHERE AVG(duration_hours) > 10
  AND WHERE user_type = 'Shared'
GROUP BY user_id
ORDER BY avg_charging_duration;
```

RESULT: ERROR
* There is a syntax eror near `WHERE` ... is it because I called `AVG(duration_hours)` instead of the alias `avg_charging_hours` ?
  * Edit: No, this did not resolve the error
* I have to look it up; I can't figure out my error

————Query attempt #2:
I'm pretty sure my issue was `WHERE avg_charging_duration = 'Shared'`. The issue is that `AVG(duration_hours)` is an aggregate function, and `WHERE` cannot be used with aggregate functions, so I should instead use `HAVING`. 

```
SELECT user_id, AVG(duration_hours) AS avg_charging_duration
FROM charging_sessions
WHERE user_type ='Shared'
GROUP BY user_id
HAVING AVG(duration_hours) > 10
ORDER BY avg_charging_duration DESC;
```

Impression: 
* This seems to have worked!
* I got an output of 6 users, and each one has a charging time of more than 10 hours.

<details>
  <summmary> See the 6 users here </summmary>

| user_id  | avg_charging_duration |
|----------|-----------------------|
| Share-9  | 16.84583334           |
| Share-17 | 12.89455555           |

## Scoring / reflection

My results were all right! But there were two small errors:
1. The project was updated. It originally asked #1 to be limited to 5 rows, and this request has since been delted, so I had to remove `LIMIT 5` from my query.
2. I forgot to alias `COUNT(start_plugin_hour)` as `num_charging_sessions`

Reflections:
1. Most of my mistakes were not due to issues with SQL, but rather dumb mistakes I made due to not reading instructions carefully enoguh...
2. I should make a diagram showing which functions can be used with which functions........
3. I wonder why aggregate functions _can't_ be used with `WHERE`? Is there a good reason for this?
