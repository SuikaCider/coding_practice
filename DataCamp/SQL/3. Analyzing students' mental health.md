# Analyzing students' mental health

Does going to university in a different country affect your mental health? A Japanese international university surveyed its students in 2018 and published a study the following year that was approved by several ethical and regulatory boards.

The study found that international students have a higher risk of mental health difficulties than the general population, and that social connectedness (belonging to a social group) and acculturative stress (stress associated with joining a new culture) are predictive of depression.

Explore the `students` data using PostgreSQL to find out if you would come to a similar conclusion for international students and see if the length of stay is a contributing factor.

Here is a data description of the columns you may find helpful.

## Project progress

[√] Created GitHub landing page  

[] Tried project once by myself  

[] Checked solution — annotated what I learned if my answer was wrong  

[] Document will not be edited further

  ## Preliminary questions 
I would like to run a few queries to see what this database looks like before I begin attempting to answer the assignment's questions.

### Question I: What am I working with, here?

```
SELECT * 
FROM students
LIMIT 10;
```

Impressions:
* That's... that's... a massive amount of columns
* Ok, I guess I'm going to start by `COUNT()`'ing some of the pieces of data and getting rough `AVG()`'s of other things

### Question II: What do these 3 tests mean, anyway?

The database records the scores certain students got on three tests. I spent some time reading about what these different dests measure, and also using some aggregate functions to learn about the range of possible scores for each test. 

* [PHQ-9 test](https://med.stanford.edu/fastlab/research/imapp/msrs/_jcr_content/main/accordion/accordion_content3/download_256324296/file.res/PHQ9%20id%20date%2008.03.pdf) → a self-report screening test for likelihood/severity depression.
  * Total score indicated by `todep` (min=0, avg=8, maxObserved=25, maxPossible=27)
  * Individual items also listed (9 total)
* [SCS test](https://scales.arabpsychology.com/s/social-connectedness-scale/) → a self-report questoinnaire that assesses 4 dimensions of social connectedness (belongingness, closeness, support, satisfaction).
  * Total score indicated by `tosc` (min=8, max=48, avg=37)
  * Individual items also listed (8 total)
  * A more updated version of this test exists (SCS-R) with 20 items   
* [ASISS test](https://www.libs.uga.edu/reserves/docs/scans/lundeen%20-%20an%20acculturative.pdf) → a self-report test that records how much stress an immigrant (here: international student) feels while navigating the acculturation process. 
  * Total score indicated by `toas` (min=36. avg=72, maxObserved=145, maxPossible=180)
  * 1–5 Likert rating of 36 statements, grouped into 7 categories

  ## Assignment questions 

  ### 🎯 Question #1: How does staying in a different country impact your mental health?
  
Question text:
> Explore and analyze the students data to see how the length of stay (stay) impacts the average mental health diagnostic scores of the international students present in the study.
>
> Requriements:
> * Nine rows, five columns
> * Column namess & order: `stay`, `count_int`, `average_phq`, `average_scs`, and `average_as`
> * `AVG()` columns should be rounded to 2 decimal places
> * `count_int` column should show how many learners stayed for each "time interval"
> * Results sorted in descending order
>
> Notes: This might take multiple cells/queries!

Impression:
* This is a long question!
* I haven't done a project that required multiple queries working together before..
* I need to review how `ROUND()` works
* What's a DataFrame? Is it a thing, or just a DataCamp thing?
